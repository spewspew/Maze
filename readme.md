Maze Puzzle
===========

Co-workers of mine suggested the following puzzle as a programming
exercise:

* Write a program that randomly generates a solvable maze.

This was written for Plan 9 and its C libraries. This is the 
[recursive backtracker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker)
algorithm though I found that out after I finished writing it.
